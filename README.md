## Content:
- **3_3_small.csv:** Dataset for a 3x3 Hex game, achieving complete accuracy.
- **Hex_graph_representation.ipynb:** Code to represent the Hex game as a graph structure.
- **Improved_Similar_sample.ipynb:** Implementation of 3x3 Hex games, achieving complete accuracy.
- **Version_7_7_game.ipynb:** Implementation for a 7x7 Hex game model with positional property, cell values, and centered\edged for each node.
- **Version_85_confusion.ipynb:** The same with 'Version_7_7_game.ipynb', but advanced analysis for 85% accuracy.
- **Version_7_7_game_95.ipynb:** The same with 'Version_7_7_game.ipynb', but advanced analysis for 95% accuracy.
- **Version_96_acc.ipynb:** The same with 'Version_7_7_game.ipynb', but advanced analysis for 96% accuracy.
- **Version_2moves.ipynb:** Code structure is the same as in 'Version_7_7_game.ipynb'. However is modified for 9x9 game siza and uses the dataset 'hex_9x9_2moves.csv' obtained from Yusef Said and Harald Borgenvik.
- **Version_5moves.ipynb:** Code structure is the same as in 'Version_7_7_game.ipynb'. However is modified for 9x9 game siza and uses the dataset 'hex_9x9_5moves.csv' obtained from Yusef Said and Harald Borgenvik.
- **game_generator.ipynb:** Code for generating Hex game boards programmatically.
- **test.ipynb:** Testing script for evaluating Hex game implementations.
